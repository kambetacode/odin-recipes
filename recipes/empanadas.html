<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
    <li>½ medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup Goya Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>6 Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Goya Sofrito</li>
    <li>1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Goya Minced Garlic</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Goya Dried Oregano</li>
    <li>Goya Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) package yellow or white Goya Discos empanada discs, thawed</li>
    <li>1 quart Goya Corn Oil, for frying</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).</li>
    <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
